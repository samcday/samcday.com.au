I've always wished I could be better at design. Growing up, my artistic style
extended as far as drawing mazes and stick figures - most of the latter looking
like they had been horribly deformed by a tragic car accident.

The thing is though, I have always been painfully aware that creating something
interesting, something people can get excited about, something people will show
to their friends, is just as much about the design as it is the functionality.
I had this revelation very early on in my career, but I've never had the 
patience to learn enough about design to apply it practically to things I 
create, in either my career or my personal endeavours.

I'm trying to change that now though, and with amazing resources like 
[Hack Design](http://hackdesign.org/), I may actually have a shot at learning
a thing or two about design.

### Kerning?

Tonight I was going through the second lesson on typography, and came across
the fascinating [Kerning Game](http://type.method.ac/) site. It presents a few
simple exercises, in which words of differing serif/sans serif fonts have had 
their kerning messed up, and your task is to restore them to their optimal 
spacing. I'm usually terrified of trying stuff like this, as I don't like being
reminded of things I'm not good at, but I decided to give it a go.

As it would turn out, I'm a little better at kerning type than I am at drawing
stick figures, as I managed to score **93/100** overall for the 10 exercises
presented! I'm not sure if this site was sneakily placed in the Hack Design 
course to give an early morale booster, but hidden agendas be damned! I'm 
feeling really encouraged and am going to stick at this design thing!
